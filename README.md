# BungeeBlocker
### BungeeCord client version blocker plugin that will deny connections to your backend (Paper/Bukkit) servers
This plugin was created for my server originally, then I realized how useful it could be for other server owner's.
 Now I know you could just use ViaVersion's version blocker, but if you're like me you want to allow 1.7 connections to your proxy, 
 and to do this you must have ViaVersion & its addons on your proxy server(BungeeCord). 
 My plugin allows you to list what versions you want too allow on your backend server. 
 You can remove your server list from the configuration any time and the plugin will not interact with it.
